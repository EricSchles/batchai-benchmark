# Distributed Training with BatchAI

Batch AI enables easy cluster provisioning and job scheduling with deep learning
frameworks in mind (CNTK, Tensorflow).

## Get Started with Examples

To get started, refer to [Provision Clusters and Run Jobs](https://github.com/Smarker/batchai-benchmark/tree/master/easy-cluster#provision-a-cluster-and-run-jobs).

## Monitoring Training Performance

To view Horovod's `timeline` and Tensorflow's `tensorboard` refer to
