# Provision a Cluster and Run Jobs

`easy-cluster.sh` is an interactive script to help provision Batch AI clusters.

The `easy-cluster.sh` script contains two training examples and will walk you]
through how to easily set them up on your own cluster:

1. `CNTK` with a `ConvNet` model on `MNIST` data
2. `Horovod` with a `CNN` model on `CIFAR-10` data

## Run Interactive Batch AI Script

```sh
./easy-cluster.sh
```
